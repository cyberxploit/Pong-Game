# Pong-Game
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
In this case Player1 uses the "w" & "s" keys to move around while Player2 uses the "up" & "down" arrow keys to move to and fro.
